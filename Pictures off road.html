        The Toyota Fortuner, also known as the Toyota SW4, is a mid-size SUV manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota since 2004. Built on the Hilux pickup truck platform, it features two/three rows of seats and is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configuration. It is a part of Toyota's IMV project for emerging markets, which also includes the Hilux and the Innova.
        
        The name Fortuner is derived from the English word fortune.</p>

        <p>The Hilux debuted in March 1968 as a new bonnet-type truck that integrated and succeeded the Briska and the Light Stout. The vehicle was conceived by Toyota, and was developed and manufactured by Hino Motors, Ltd. at its Hamura Plant. The engine was a 1.5-liter 70 PS unit (2R) that was also used on the Toyoace.</p>

        <p>Since 1990, the smaller variation of the Land Cruiser has been marketed as the Land Cruiser Prado. Described as a 'light-duty' version of the Land Cruiser by Toyota, it features a different design compared to the full-size model and, up until 2023, it remains the only comfort-oriented Land Cruiser available with a short-wheelbase 3-door version.</p>

        <p>As a tribute to Hilux's 50th anniversary, Toyota has unveiled the Legend 50, replacing the Raider as the Hilux's most luxurious model. For this reason, there are a total of 13 distinct Legend models to choose from</p>
        <p>History provides a record of iconic figures, events and ‘things’ in an attempt to preserve the memory, status and essence of the subject at hand. Some call it iconic, others remarkable, memorable or even epic. 

            The Hilux nameplate has obtained legendary status globally, forged by adventures, expeditions, quests and even over-ambitious television shows. The humble bakkie in '4x4' guise has reached all corners of the globe and gained a cult-like following in the process.
            
            In South Africa the story is no different, first launched in 1969, Hilux has firmly rooted itself in the SA motoring landscape and become the best-selling bakkie. </p>
